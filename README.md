# terraform-updater
A simple terraform installation and update script

As long as Hashicorp provides absolutely no repos/PPAs for Terraform, there should be any simple way to install and update it, regardless of your distribution. Just download and run this script, close your terminal, and use the "terraform" and "terraform-updater" commands.
